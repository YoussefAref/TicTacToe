# TicTacToe
This code brings the game TicTacToe to life where it takes the input from the two players and compares it with the rules of the actual game where if the player tries to use the same block that was used ti would give an error message same as if the number that was less the the number of blocks (1-9) then the game would end.
Finally whoever ends up winning depending on if they are player X or player O the code will print out the winner.
